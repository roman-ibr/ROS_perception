The repository contain the following examples: 
* Use OpenCV with ROS
* Make robots track objects by their colour blobs
* Make robots navigate following floor lines with only a RGB camera







The above mentioned topics were applied on several robots: 
* Mira Robot for blob tracking
* TurtleBot for line following
* Aibo Robot for a project of line following and block delection
